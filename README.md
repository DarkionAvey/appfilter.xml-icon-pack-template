<div align="center"><h2>Android appfilter.xml icon pack template</h2></div>

A complete list of appfilter.xml along with default app icons. Your next icon pack starts here 

This repo contains two entries:
1. ``appfilter.xml`` which contains more than 7000 icon definitions. 
2. Original apps' icons. These icons were downloaded from Play Store and/or other app stores to help you get started with designing your custom icons without wasting time.

You can either copy the raw ``appfilter.xml`` directly to your project, or download the complete repository with the icons included. Beware, repo size is 300MB+

# License
You can do whatever you want with the ``appfilter.xml``
